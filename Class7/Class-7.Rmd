##Class 7
###Recap: How to Use Functions
Q6 Homework: Make sure you understand what each line of code does. Must be a separate file from in class activities in an R Markdown file.

Structure: `fname <- function(arg1,arg2) {paste(arg1, arg2)}`
Input arguments: predefine arguments - call it 
Function body: arguments do whatever you tell them to do in the function body

Example: `rescale <- function(x, na.rm=TRUE, plot=FALSE, ...) {
 rng <-range(x, na.rm=na.rm)
 answer <- (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
 if(plot) {
 plot(answer, ...)
 }
 return(answer)
}'

rescale = function

For multiple conditions, use "if" statements: branching logic trees to return different values for different conditions.

##Process for Coding a Function
1. Start with a simple problem and write a working snippet of code.
2. Rewrite and use temporary variables
3. Rewrite for clarity and to reduce calculation duplication
4. Turn into an initial function with clear useful names
5. Test on small well defined input and (subsets of) real input
6. Report on potential problem by failing early and loudly!
7. Refine and polish 

These are functions, look here!
```{r}
#Functions
is_both_na <- function(x,y){
  if(length(x)!=length(z)){
    stop("Your inputs are not the same lengths.")
  }
  is.na(x) & is.na(y)
}

rescale_new <- function(x, y) {
 if(length(x) != length(y)) {
 stop("Input x and y should be vectors of the same length", call.=FALSE)
 }
na.in.both<- (is.na(x) & is.na(y))
 na.number <- sum(na.in.both)
 na.which <- which(na.in.both)
 
 message("Found ", na.number, " NA's at position(s):",
 paste(na.which, collapse=", ") )

 return( list(number=na.number, which=na.which) )
}

rescale <- function(x, na.rm=TRUE, plot=FALSE, ...) {
  ##Our rescale function from the end of lecture 6
 if( !is.numeric(x) ) {
 stop("Input x should be numeric", call.=FALSE)
 }
 rng <-range(x, na.rm=na.rm)

 answer <- (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
 if(plot) {
 plot(answer, ...)
 }
 return(answer)
}
```


# The functions warning() and stop()
These are used inside functions to handle and report on unexpected situations
• They both print a user defined message (which you supply as a
character input argument to the warning() and stop() functions).
• However, warning() will keep on going with running the function
body code whereas stop() will terminate the action of the
function.
• A common idiom is to use stop("some message") to report on
unexpected input type or other problem early in a function,
- i.e. "Fail early and loudly!"

Use warning for tolerable error and stop for tolerable error.

In `rescale2`, we are generating an error we can act on and prevent. We want this function to act on everything that is TRUE.

Providing a warning can help give a more specific error message as to what the issue is.

```{r}
# Lets define an example x and y
x <- c( 1, 2, NA, 3, NA)
y <- c(NA, 3, NA, 3, 4)
z<- c(1,1)
```
How to test if there is an NA value as opposed to a numeric value without looking at the data set?
`is.na` function will provide TRUE/FALSE statement to every variable in a vector.

In `rescale_new`, remember that TRUE =1 & FALSE=0, so to sum a binary vector will tell how many true and falses exist.

`rm()` removes a variable/function in global environment.

```{r}
x<- df1$IDs
y<- df2$IDs

intersect(x,y)

x %in% y
x
x[x %in% y]

y
y%in%x
y[y%in%x]


cbind(x[x %in% y], y[y%in%x])
```
`%in%` gives which elements of X are in Y. Gives us a logical index that allows us to pull all data from data frame.
`x[x%in%y]` pulls variables of x that are in y: "Which variables of X fulfill the condition of which elements of x are also in y?"

`cbind` binds two matrices as single intersected unit.

```{r}
gene_intersect <- function(x, y) {
  cbind(x[x %in% y], y[y%in%x])
}

gene_intersect2 <- function(df1,df2) {
  cbind(df1[df1$IDs %in% df2$IDs,], 
        df2[df2$IDs %in% df1$IDs, ], "exp")
}


gene_intersect3 <- function(df1,df2, gene.colname = "IDs") {
  cbind(df1[df1[,gene.colname] %in% df2[,gene.colname],], 
        df2[df2[,gene.colname] %in% df1[,gene.colname], ], "exp")
}



gene_intersect4 <- function(df1,df2, gene.colname = "IDs") {
  df1.name <-df1[,gene.colname]
  df2.name <-df2[,gene.colname]
  
  df1.inds<-df1.name %in% df2.name
  df2.inds<-df2.name %in% df1.name
  
  cbind(df1[ df1.inds,], 
        df2[df2.inds, ], "exp")
}

df1$IDs
gene.colname = "IDs"

colnames(df1) <- c("new_name","exp")
df1

x<- df1$IDs
y<- df2$IDs
gene_intersect(x,y)

gene_intersect2(df1, df2)

gene_intersect3(df1, df2, gene.colname = "IDs")

gene_intersect4(df1, df2, gene.colname = "new_name")

###Must add commas in `gene_intersect 2` to include every element in each dataframe, not just the IDs

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#CRAN and Bioconductor

CRAN has over 15,000 R packages to download.
Can Google packages or can go to CRAN website > Packages
Come in all shapes, sizes, and qualities - check for most updated packages (within last year)

##Installing a package from CRAN
RStudio > Tools > Install Packages
`install.packages("packagename")`

Bioconductor emphasizes reproducible research and high-thoroughput genomic data.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
dim(iris)
class(iris)
head(iris)
levels(iris$Species)
```


R Graph Gallery website shows all types of graphs that can be generated through R.

##ggplot2
-Must be data

##Aesthetics
-how data is represented visually
-Which data on x axis and which on y
-But also: color, size, shape, transparency for arguments

## Geometry
Geometric objects (points, lines, polygons) in the object
Shortcut functions: `geom_point()`, `geom_bar()`, `geom_line()`
Must use plus signs between ggplot and geom functions

```{r}
myplot<-ggplot(data=iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y =Sepal.Width)) ##Initialize a ggplot object, not an actual plot
class(myplot)

ggplot(data=iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + geom_point(aes(shape=Species),size=3) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_bar(stat='count')
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
